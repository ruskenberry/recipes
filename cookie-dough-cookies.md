## Ingredients

* 2 sticks unsalted European-style butter, room temperature, cut into cubes
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
* 1 large egg
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* splash whole milk
* 1 3/4 cup flour
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons non-fat milk powder (optional)
* 2 cups mini chocolate chips

## Directions

* Heat oven to 500Â° F.

* Combine butter and both sugars in a standing mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix for 1-2 minutes, or until ingredients are fully mixed.

* Add in egg, vanilla, and splash of whole milk. Mix on high for 2-3 minutes, or until it becomes fluffy. It should double in size and be a pale color.

* Add in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, milk powder (if using), and chocolate chips. Mix 1 minute, or until dry ingredients are just incorporated.

* Scoop cookie dough balls, about 1/4 cup each, onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet 2-3 inches apart, and flatten with the palm of your hand.

* Bake for for 3-5 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown on the edges but still raw in the middle. Throw in freezer immediately to stop the baking process. Store and serve directly from fridge.
