## Ingredients

* 12 chicken wings, "frenched" (optional, or ask your butcher to do this)
* canola oil, for frying
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter
* freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Directions

* Place 4-inches of oil in a large saucepan and heat until a deep-fry thermometer reaches 300°F|150°C. Working in 2 batches, cook the wings for 8 minutes. Increase the temperature to 375°F|190°C and cook the wings for an additional 5 to 7 minutes, or until crispy and the wings reach an internal temperature of 165°F|74°C. Transfer the wings to a cooling rack.

* Meanwhile. melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden and toasted, about 3 minutes. Add in the remaining butter, the parmesan, and pepper and cook until melted, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wings and toss well to coat. Add more black pepper and transfer to a platter to serve.
