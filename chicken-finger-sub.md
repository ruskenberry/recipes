## Ingredients

Servings: 2

* 2 1/2 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise, plus more to taste
* 1/4 cup buttermilk
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
* kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 1 pounds chicken tenderloins
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 3 eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 cup plain breadcrumbs
* canola oil, for frying
* 1/4 cup Frank's hot sauce
* 2 foot long sub rolls, halved lengthwise and toasted
* 10 slices provolone cheese
* 2 cups shredded iceburg lettuce
* 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced
* 1 jar hot pepper rings, drained
* 1 small white onion, thinly sliced

## Directions

* Make the blue cheese dressing: In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, blue cheese, buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper and set aside.

* Place the flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate, shallow dishes. Season the flour with salt and pepper and, working with one tenderloin at a time, dredge the chicken in the flour, then the eggs, then the breadcrumbs.

* Heat the oil to 350°F|175°C. Working in batches, cook the chicken until golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and toss in the hot sauce.

* Assemble the sub: Spread mayonnaise on the inside of the sub rolls. Divide the chicken between the 2 rolls and top with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, hot peppers. Slice in half and enjoy!
