## Ingredients

Servings 8-10

* 1 cup brown sugar
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* ¾ cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1 egg
* 1 egg yolk
* 2 tablespoons light or dark corn syrup (totally optional, but adds a touch  of chewiness that I like)
* 3 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 ½ cups chopped chocolate (I like to use a combination of milk and semisweet)
* ½ cup sprinkles
* Maldon or *fleur de sel*, for sprinkling

## Directions

* Heat your oven to 350°F. Add your brown sugar and granulated sugar to the bowl of your mixer. Melt your butter in a microwave-safe bowl, then add it to your sugar. Beat for 3 minutes or so, until well combined - the mixture should look like wet sand. Add in your egg, beat fully, then add in your egg yolk, and beat until fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides of your bowl. Beat in your corn syrup (if using) and your vanilla.

* In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together your flour, baking soda, and salt. Add half of the flour mixture to your dough, beat to combine, then add in the rest, and beat to combine, being careful not to over-mix your dough. Fold in your chopped chocolate and sprinkles.

* Roll your dough into 2-tablespoon sized balls and place them about 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets, and sprinkle lightly with salt. Bake for 11-13 minutes or so, until golden and mostly set but not browned. Allow the cookies to cool slightly on your baking sheets for 5 minutes or so, before moving them to another surface to cool completely. These will keep well, covered in an airtight container, at room temperature, for up to 5 days. These cookies will also freeze well for up to 3 months.
